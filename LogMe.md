Revised the repo format. Changed this doc to "log" and created a "RM" for visitors. I hope they like the extra love I put into the presentation! Despite that, I'm nearing the completion of the the first tut. It has been very rewarding... even though I am dead tired when I get home. As with all repos, I really hope this isn't a waist of time. I know I've already learned so much. I just haven't recorded that within the logs.

Following some tuts in YT. Let's see how much time I can give this side side side project!
