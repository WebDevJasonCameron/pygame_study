I'm at the stage that I can add sound to this first "game" intro tut. Afterwards, I need to provide examples to the readme. Then I want to mod it with some different graphics to make it feel like it is my own. Not that I can pass the code as my own... or really the artwork. I just want to go through the follow-along-code to see if I can understand it. Next, I will try to go through the long Zelda-like pygame tut. That will probably take me a really long time. Still... it is fun and I don't get to do much fun stuff at work. However, that is a different story for another place. ~Cheers

## 2022 11 13 | Update

Continuing the tutorial between work and life. I am currently stuck on a bug where anim fails. I added the movement anim to the player. This includes the walk and jump. These are suppose to trigger as the start of the game begins. If the character is above the y axis of 300, then the single frame jump triggers. Gravity does the rest. The problem I get is that the "tuple doesn't have a 'y' instance." (something like that) If I comment out line 149, it goes on the cause more problems. What I need to do is watch the tut again and see if I missed something. Right now, I'm trying to look at the logic to understand why the error is saying what it says. Finally, the code the instructor gives is based on the final product. This means, things do not look like they would at part 3hours and 21 minutes into the video. Instead I have a fully working product or a working product with commented out code representing different point in tut time. Both are great and I'm not complaining. I'm just pointing out that one needs to still dig into their own broken code... that makes you stronger as a programmer!

Revised the repo format. Changed this doc to "log" and created a "RM" for visitors. I hope they like the extra love I put into the presentation! Despite that, I'm nearing the completion of the the first tut. It has been very rewarding... even though I am dead tired when I get home. As with all repos, I really hope this isn't a waist of time. I know I've already learned so much. I just haven't recorded that within the logs.

Following some tuts in YT. Let's see how much time I can give this side side side project!
