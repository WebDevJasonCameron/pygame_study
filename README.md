# PyGame_Study

I have gotten out of the habit of making great ReadMe documents explaining why I'm doing what I'm doing and letting visitors know what the purpose and plans are for the repos I create. Mostly this is because I'm so busy actually studying or working on actual employed work that it really is a slip of the mind. Yet, when I occasionally review a peer's work, I find it almost sad that there isn't anything explaining why the started a new repo (or where they are in an old one). It's like visiting an old friend's house to find that no one is home and you'd like to see what they've been up to. I digress...

## Purpose

This repo is simply a personal study into Python's PyGame resource. I've been interested in the subject for ages but never took the time to actually see how it works. I'd like to take the next few months exploring some incredible YouTube videos on the topic. Clear Code's [Ultimate Introduction to PyGame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&t=6614s) is the first of many tutorials. Actually, what convinced me to go ahead and dive into this topic is his 10+ hour tutorial on creating a Zelda-like game with PyGame. Since, I'm spending much of my day time trying my best to grok the thousands of lines of python code someone else wrote, I thought this would be a great way to relax and be creative in the same medium I'm currently working in.

## Goals

- [ ] Complete Ultimate Intro to PyGame
- [ ] Complete Zelda-like Game with Python
- [ ] Deploy a ten minute game for my daughter to try and play
- [ ] Become fluid enough with the language to help me better read other's code
- [ ] Create the next mineCraft, sell it for twice the amount, live happily ever after
